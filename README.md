# HACKtheC

Under our platform, organizations can register and provide their smart contracts and address of the  smart contract( on testnet). 
They can indicate whether their smart contracts involve funds or not. If it does, and a hacker is able to transfer all the funds from the smart contract to their own account, they will be awarded a bounty. The organizations do not need to manually transfer the bounty, but instead set the bounty amount on the contract during registration. The bounty amount will be stored in the smart contract and will be automatically transferred to the hacker. The organizations can then address the bug through the submitted proof of concept and the hacker's wallet address history.
If the smart contract deals with data, and a hacker discovers a bug, they can submit proof of concept and the organization will manually award the hacker after validating the bug.
